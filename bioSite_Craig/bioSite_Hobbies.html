        <h1>Home Remodeling</h1>
        
        <p>In his spare time, Craig loves working on the big old farmhouse that he and his wife 
            bought to house all their kids.  He used YouTube videos to learn "how to" complete the
            projects he has finished.  He is already watching new videos for future projects.  He
            is currently working on building an office for his wife who is about to start her new 
            career in software development.  He gutted an indoor patio attached to the garage.  He 
            insulated, drywalled, mudded, and painted the walls.  He installed new windows, siding, 
            and shingles.  He leveled the floor and installed new trim.  He also added several more outlets.</p>
        <p>Some of Craig's more recent projects include completely gutting and rebuilding a second floor 
            bathroom for his three daughters.  He replaced the flooring with a newly leveled, tile floor.
            He put in a new vanity, sink, and mirror.  He replaced the tub/shower combination
            and toilet.  He put in new lights and exhaust fan.  With the help of his daughters, 
            he repainted all the walls.  He also removed all of the wallpaper in all three of the 
            upstairs bedrooms, orange peeled and painted the walls.  </p>
        <p>Some of his original projects included installing new lighting, a new front door, and a porch swing
            on the front porch. He built a batting cage for his family in the backyard as well as a practice field
            for volleyball.  He put in new pipes throughout the house using new pex pipes and a water manifold
            system. He also built a bedroom in the basement for one of his sons so everyone could have their own rooms.
            Craig's next project is going to be rewiring and refinishing the movie room.</p>
